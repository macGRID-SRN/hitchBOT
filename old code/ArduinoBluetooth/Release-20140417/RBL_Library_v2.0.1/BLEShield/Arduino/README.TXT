RBL BLE Shield library version 2.0

Put Nordic_BLE and RBL_BLEShield folders to Arduino libraries folder and load the examples from RBL_BLEShield.

The BLE Shield library provides APIs for your sketch.

The library structure and dependency:
YourSketch.ino -> RBL_BLEShield -> Nordic_BLE

Also, you can use Nordic's library directly such as:
YourSketch.ino -> Nordic_BLE

Read Nordic's BLE SDK for Arduino for details.

Note: Remove library version 1.0 (if you have) before to use version 2.0, do not use 1.0 and 2.0 libraries at the same time.

The BLEFirmata sketch requires BLE Arduino iOS App to play, you can download it from on Apple App Store.
