I am now confident the current solution for the speaker system is more than enough. The output from the 5V stepdown boards are connected to the 1A Lithium battery charging boards. A 3000mAh 3.7V battery is attached to the charging board. The output (which is stepped up to 5V) is then hooked up to a USB breakout board. The USB powered speakers are then plugged into this.

From testing I have determined the speaker uses very little power. Since it is very hard to measure the current being drawn with the tools I have, I will just have to round it up a lot. I am assuming the current draw to be 250mAh. 

Assuming an 80% effiecency of everything, this should give a battery life of about 7 hours.

This is acceptable as we determined the minimum overall battery life to be 4 hours.
