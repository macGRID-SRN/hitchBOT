This is a CleverScript pre-compiler module for hitchBOT.
The purpose of this module is to translate a tab-separated file that is ready
for input to CleverScript, and parse that file into a language model.
The language model output by this module consists of all of the possible
input combinations as defined by the tab-separated input file.

test-in-german and hello-german.txt are to test support of German special
characters and to test the entire German input file, respectively.

Racket can be downloaded from racket-lang.org.

To run:
raco make make-language-model.rkt
racket make-language-model.rkt input-file output-file

where input-file is some input file-name and output-file is some output file-name.

E.g.,

racket make-language-model.rkt hello.txt test-output
