This is a 3-gram language model, based on a vocabulary of 721 words,
  which begins "325", "A", "ABOUT"...
This is a CLOSED-vocabulary model
  (OOVs eliminated from training data and are forbidden in test data)
Good-Turing discounting was applied.
1-gram frequency of frequency : 434 
2-gram frequency of frequency : 1448 156 52 32 13 6 3 
3-gram frequency of frequency : 1944 107 26 9 2 4 1 
1-gram discounting ratios : 0.00 
2-gram discounting ratios : 0.20 0.49 0.82 0.50 0.55 0.58 
3-gram discounting ratios : 0.11 0.36 0.46 0.27 
This file is in the ARPA-standard format introduced by Doug Paul.

p(wd3|wd1,wd2)= if(trigram exists)           p_3(wd1,wd2,wd3)
                else if(bigram w1,w2 exists) bo_wt_2(w1,w2)*p(wd3|wd2)
                else                         p(wd3|w2)

p(wd2|wd1)= if(bigram exists) p_2(wd1,wd2)
            else              bo_wt_1(wd1)*p_1(wd2)

All probs and back-off weights (bo_wt) are given in log10 form.
